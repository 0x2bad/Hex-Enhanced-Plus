# Installation instructions
HexEnhanced+ is a userscript, so you will need a userscript manager. The most used ones are [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chrome and [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox.

Once you got a userscript manager installed, click [here](https://github.com/Johannes2306/Hex-Enhanced-Plus/raw/master/HexEnhancedPlus.user.js) to open the installation window.

If you have Automatic Updating enabled in your userscript manager you will automatically get the latest updates. If you don't have this enabled, you will have to click on the installation link every time you want to update it. This will take you to your userscript manager where you will have the ability to update it manually.
